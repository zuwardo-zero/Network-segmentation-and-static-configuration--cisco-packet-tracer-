This cisco packet tracer lab is about creating a network and applying segmentation in order to obtain multupile subnets .
The first two main subnets are similar and have two end users connected to a switch while the third subnet has a server connected to a switch 
each divided network is connected to a router and the three routers are connected to eachother , this sumilation can represent the setup of three departements and their connectevity
The objective is to successfully connect the subnets which would require to set the arp table for this network  
We can start by setting a static configuration and give an ip address for each device and an ip address for each subnet 
Test the connectevity in a subnet between two devices by using the interface or by using the device terminal and applying the command ping -ip address- 
After configuring the connection between end-users in each subnets we can move to configure the gateway ip addresses for the routers
Real time sumilations can also help to detect any issues
